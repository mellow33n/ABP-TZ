An application for retrieving information based on a VIN code.

The application is built with React and utilizes React Router for navigation. Data is managed using the Redux toolkit state manager. The input form supports minimal data validation (field is not empty, no more than 17 characters, and no prohibited symbols). Validation errors and API response messages (Message field) are displayed in the interface. The application keeps a history of the last 5 requests and allows applying them for re-displaying results.

Functionality tested on the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox as of 03.02.23.

The layout is responsive and displays content correctly across screen resolutions ranging from 320 to 1920 px. It adheres to semantic HTML and BEM naming conventions for class names.
